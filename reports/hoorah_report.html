I had an unsettling experience at Hoorah that I think people should know about.One of the servers, Antonio, was extremely unprofessional and made me feel unsafe. He repeatedly invaded my personal space, was overly touchy, and even offered me free drinks, which only added to my discomfort.Despite bringing this issue to the manager's attention over the phone, nothing was done. This kind of behavior is completely inappropriate, and customers should be able to enjoy their meal without feeling harassed. Under these circumstances I won't be back although the food was really tasty. If you visit this place, I'd recommend asking for a different server and avoiding him completely.
WHY WE WENT HERE:- brunchTHE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE):- located in a plaza off Bernardo Center Dr; closest cross street is Bernardo Heights Pkwy - located next door to Daboba Rancho BernardoTHE LOOK (FROM THE INSIDE):- main seating area on one side; tea/coffee bar and semi private/quieter seating on the other sideTHE MENU:- breakfast specials- fresh start- omelettes- benedicts- signature pancakes- French toast & waffles- breakfast America- wraps - burritos and hash- burgers- sandwiches- fresh garden- kids menu- lunch specials- side orders WHAT WE ORDERED:- 1st time we came here was Valentine's Day; we opted for mimosas with regular orange juice, lox benedict, New York steak hash, and grilled New York steak benedict- 2nd time we came here was Presidents' Day; we opted for steak and eggs, and stuffed French toast with strawberriesTHE TASTE:- all the savory food was lackluster; New York steak was rubbery both times- stuffed French toast with strawberries was VERY well done!CUSTOMER SERVICE:- server on Valentine's Day was rude to the other workers assisting him with placing our orders on the table- server on Presidents' Day was great!
Excellent food!  Two had breakfast -- amazing portions of pancakes with fresh fruit!!  Third had lunch -- burger was right on target -- a bit of a different twist with pineapple!!!   Loved it (plus leftovers...)Food: 5/5  |  Service: 4/5  |  Atmosphere: 4/5 …More
Food was good...Atmosphere was a little loud and chaotic  -- didn't seem like a well ran (the kitchen seemed well ran, but the hostess/seating left much to be desired... there'd be empty tables that were clean, but they weren't seating people at them.... it felt like they were trying to create artificial waits to make the place seem busier... and yes they had plenty of wait staff).  I was surprised to see wait staff chatting with people or standing around while the poor busboy was always behind and few of the wait staff helped him.Regardless... once we were seated they took our order quickly, food was timely, etcIf they can dial in getting tables bussed by using wait staff help and better tracking of the clean tables or tables that are being cleaned, then they could really get through more people on the weekend.Note: this is the type of place where you get your own coffee and tea at a coffee/tea station.Food: 5/5  |  Service: 3/5  |  Atmosphere: 3/5Food was good...Atmosphere was a little loud and chaotic  -- didn't seem like a well ran (the kitchen seemed well ran, but the hostess/seating left much to be desired... …More
Descent food with good sized portions. It took us a while to be seated, so I would recommend trying to get a reservation (especially if it's Sunday brunch). The patio seating allowed us to enjoy the sun and breeze. I think some of the food waiting a while to come out, as it was not the warmest. Even the hollandaise was cool and congealed. Give it a shot on a not so busy day. I'm sure the experience gets better.
The food was mediocre at best. The service was pretty bad; our waiter, I don't know his name but early 20s with a bullnose peircing had a cold demeanor and quite rude. We asked for a high chair for our little one and he told us they were all being used and had to wait..which isn't a problem. But then we noticed new people coming in to eat and they were getting high chairs. He didn't give us one of our orders. Gave us an attitude when ordering our food with him and said nothing when walking away from taking it. Sort of just randomly put plates of food in front of us with no regard to who ordered what. And he was only being nice when it came time to pay the check and leave a tip.
"Lovely local brunch spot with a fresh breakfast menu. Nothing felt greasy and portions are more than fair for the price. The staff is also very sweet.My recent addiction is their Ube Latte - sub with coconut milk. Perfect for someone who wants a cozy drink but isn't a coffee lover.Food: 5/5  |  Service: 5/5  |  Atmosphere: 5/5Parking space

Awesome and friendly service, many delicious dishes to choose from. Great family restaurant. Enjoy!
Decided to grab some breakfast today an did a yelp search for breakfast near by. Looked at some of the pictures and the steak, egg and potatoes caught my eye, so I made my way to the restaurant. Once I sat down I looked at the menu and was surprised by everything they had which  everything looked good. Decided to get the chilaquiles and a mocha latte. Coffee came out first and the food came right out right after, I was surprised how fast it came out. Overall, food was DELICIOUS! Mocha had a hint of cinnamon to it I believe, but it was good, will definitely come back here and try everything on the menu. Service was top notch too. Server said if I didn't like it, after I asked what he thought of it, he would take it back...don't think there was anything left on the plate when I was done.
